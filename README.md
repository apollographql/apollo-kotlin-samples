# Apollo Kotlin Samples

This repository contains samples and recipes for advanced features of the [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) library. You can open each subproject in Android Studio/IntelliJ.

The samples are non-representative of a real life application and focus on specific parts of the API. 

If you are getting started, see the [Apollo Kotlin tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin-tutorial) instead for a simple Android app example.
